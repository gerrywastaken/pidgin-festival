To Compile
==========

Untar the archive:

  tar zxvf pidgin-festival-VERSION.tar.gz

Run autogen

  ./autogen.sh

Configure:

  ./configure

  or to install using a custom install of Pidgin:

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pidgin/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --prefix=/opt/pidgin

As long as you haven't gotten any error messages during the configure script,
you'll be read to compile.  To compile just type 'make':
  
  make
  
Pidgin-Festival will install to the pidgin lib directory.  This directory is
usually /usr/local/lib/pidgin, so be sure you have write access to these
directories, or use 'su' to become root and then run 'make install':

  make install

Once thats done, you are good to go.  Restart Pidgin, go into preferences, then
to plugins.  Enable Festival.
